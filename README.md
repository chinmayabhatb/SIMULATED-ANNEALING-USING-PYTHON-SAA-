####ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION #######
Simulated Annealing means simulating a process that involves first heating and then slowly cooling some material. Algorithm was proposed by Kirkp atrick, 1980’s; then by Gellat & Vecchi between 1982 – 1983 and in 1985 by Cerny. The motivation for SA is to find the optimum solution based on the correlation among the hardening process of solids and solving large combinatorial optimization problem.  Annealing process involves achieving a solid’s bottom state by melting it at higher temperature, and slowly lowering the temperature particles position themselves in the ground state.
